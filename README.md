# Event Manager

## Introduction

Challenge 01: Event Management Platform

Your first challenge will be to reinvent event management by creating a comprehensive platform that serves as a true innovation hub. This platform is designed for a variety of competitive events, including hackathons and ideathons. Consider a world in which event tracking, submission, and judging are not just duties, but experiences. Break free from the usual and envisage a more intricate and individualized judgment system, pulling inspiration from Devpost while forging its own path. And that's not all, imagine this platform seamlessly integrating a dashboard that provides audiences with an overview of previous initiatives. It's time to transform the way we arrange and experience events!
